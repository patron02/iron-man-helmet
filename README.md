November of 2021 I built an Iron Man helmet. I used a pre-existing STL that someone else had made and modified it to fit some of my components.

I 3D printed all of the parts at home using a Prusa Printer and spray painted and smoothed them as needed.

The helmet was programmed using Arduino and was composed of multiple servo motors.

LED panels were used to make the eyes light up but were later taken off because the screws for mounting them to the eye panels were too large.
